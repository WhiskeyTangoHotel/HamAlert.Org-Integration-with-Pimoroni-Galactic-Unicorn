The Pimoroni Galactic Unicorn is a cool piece of kit that we have had our eye on for a while.  
The item is popular and sells out quickly, but we finally got our hands on one.  Summary:  It's awesome!  
After the initial "WOW!" factor diminished we went in search of a project for it.

The answer was obvious.  How many times are you sitting comfortably in your home theater room with the 
family and you miss a Morse Code CQ from one of your ham radio friends?  That's what we thought, so we 
set out to solve that inconvenient and irritating problem!
